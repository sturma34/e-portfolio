<button type="button" class="collapsible">My Relationship with Writing</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        First up, is the semester's initial assignment, in which I described my relationship with writing. This piece is particular insightful because it serves as a barometer for my expanded relationship with writing. You will find that prior to this semester, I only had exposure to writing as a way of documenting personal achievement and an academic thesis oriented style of writing. Reflecting upon this earlier stage of my writing affords me a greater appreciation of the broader horizons that I acquired through practicing new styles of writing in my longer essays.

        Writing fulfills numerous roles in the human experience, varying from being a method of recording rigorous scientific analysis to being a medium for individuals to express their innermost feelings and predilections. Hence, my personal experience and relationship with writing has been multi faceted. I have engaged in both analytical scholarly writing, serving as an editor and writer for publications in high school and beyond, and I have also used writing as method for self expression and recording my inner thoughts and feelings. These different opportunities implemented different elements of writing’s many capabilities, and enhanced several aspects of my life, including, but not limited to, my study of Torah and personal growth.
    </p>
    <p>
        My first exposure to a scholarly writing style was when I was introduced to Kol Torah, a weekly, student run Torah publication in my high school. I began to write semi-regularly for Kol Torah, eventually joining the publication team as an editor, and later accepting the role of editor-in-chief. After high school, when I was studying in Yeshivat Har Etzion, a similar opportunity presented itself. Every year, the second-year students put together a compilation of Torah articles and publish the finished the product as a book. I, along with two of my friends, agreed to serve as editors for our year’s edition. I myself wrote and published two original articles on topics that I had studied over the course of the year, and, as an editor, I was able to work with many of my peers and assist them in completing their own.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being a student in the modern Orthodox Jewish day school system, I had encountered Jewish texts and source material for the majority of my formal education. These two writing and editing opportunities, however, greatly enhanced my relationship with the text. The convergence of a formal style of writing with my Torah study impelled me to engage with the source texts with a degree of precision that would have been otherwise difficult to achieve. Writing in this manner forced me to organize my thoughts in a linear manner and clearly present Talmudic and other Jewish material that, in its raw form, is often not the most accessible to the layperson. But asides from improved clarity, this rigorous method of writing and analysis also gave me a deeper understanding and appreciation for texts that I otherwise might have examined in a more cursory manner. Finally, this writing also gave me a deeper sense of satisfaction with my studies. When someone spends many hours devoted to a particular task, even if they are aware of its inherent importance, it can sometimes be difficult to be satisfied without a concrete product. By recording my thoughts and efforts in writing, I felt accomplished and proud of my Torah study.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond the world of formal and academic writing, I have also engaged in writing as a means of recording my accomplishments, aspirations, feelings, and goals. When I was a high school senior, one of teachers (my calculus teacher, believe it or not) had the students write a letter to themselves in one years time. In this letter, I reflected upon some of my feelings about my successes in high school, and areas in I felt that further improvement was necessary. I recorded some of my innermost feelings, trying to capture the mindset of my twelfth grade self, and documented my aspirations and goals for my upcoming year of study in Israel. Receiving and reading this letter one year later was a wonderfully cathartic experience, and I decided to repeat this project, albeit in a more modern manner, as an email scheduled to arrive in my inbox one year from the time of writing. The letter I received the following year was a similarly powerful experience. One of the aspects of these letters I wrote that stood out most to me was how much I had changed from year to year. The personas that I encountered in reading each of these letters was an entirely different person, one that I almost did not even recognize. Each letter was a time capsule that captured a very specific version of my past self. Additionally, these letters served as very useful points of reference for my growth and development as an individual. I was able to carefully examine how well I had succeeded in the various goals I had set for myself, and this afforded me a sense of pride in my accomplishments. Also, I identified areas in which I still felt that I had shortcomings, and by inspecting what worked, I was able to refine my goals and reorient myself for the coming year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Writing’s manifold aspects have had a great and diverse impact on my life. Scholarly Torah writing led me to strengthen my relationship with foundational texts that I was already familiar with, because they were also texts that I had never examined and organized in such a manner. Writing as a method of recording my feelings and aspirations helped catalyze my personal development, and gain a deeper appreciation for the successes that I achieved. I hope that the writing I do in this upcoming course will allow me to further strengthen and deepen my relationship with writing, which, in turn, will allow me to enhance other aspects of my life.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Writing in the Dark Discussion Board</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        Finally, this is a response that I penned after reading the essay entitled "Writing in the Dark." In this moving piece, David Grossman describes his understanding of the power of writing.  My response below reflects that I am able to relate to the points that he makes and the style of writing that he uses to communicate them. I feel that I would not have had this level of appreciation at the beginning of the semester, and, hence, while brief, this responses is an effective indicator of my growth as a writer.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        In his essay, "Writing in the Dark," David Grossman explores the power of writing and its ability to allow the writer to process and understand the surrounding world. Through the writing process, a writer can prevent their world from becoming an overbearing conglomeration of memories, and restore a sense of dynamism to their life. By writing, one can gain a better grasp of the variegated possibilities present in life, thereby making them more nuanced and balanced. To develop this point, however, Grossman does not present a thesis upfront and proceed to defend it with factual evidence. Rather, he takes us on a journey and explains how he arrived at this conclusion. He begins by describing the human tendency to withdraw and become apathetic in the face of conflict, he then proceeds to describe writing's unique ability to alleviate this issue, and concludes by regaling in the newfound appreciation and understanding of life's complexity that writing provided. This exploration grants the reader a more comprehensive insight into Grossman's mind, and provides a fuller picture of the ideas that he develops. When writers are confined to the strictures of thesis driven writing, if they are not careful, the more nuanced aspects of their ideas can be lost in communication.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout his exploration, however, Grossman did not just examine a set of concepts and theories to arrive at his conclusion. He consistently interwove his own experience into the process, and gave it a very personal touch. For instance, in the initial stage of his exploration, he did not just assert that people tend to become desensitized and withdraw in face of their respective predicaments, rather he described his own personal situation in the war torn Middle East. Additionally, when he proceeded to describe the relieving affect of writing, he described the transformation he underwent after writing about the death of his son, Uri. Writing allowed him to create a space in which "death is not only the absolute and one-dimensional negation of life." By implementing these personal narratives, Grossman successfully concretized abstract ideas and brought them into the real world, thereby making them more relatable and digestible for the average reader.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Response Lettter to: Man Laughs, God Laughs Too</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        The following is a peer review letter that I wrote to my fellow student, Yoni Zirman, after I reviewed his personal narrative entitled "Man Laughs, God Laughs Too." Over the course of the semester, as we completed each of our essays, our class also completed increasingly intensive peer reviews. This was the first peer review that we completed; each student was paired up with another indidual, carefully reviewed their essays, and wrote a personally addressed letter in response. While personal letters do not have the benefit of variegated feedback from a group, the one on one communication allowed for close review and directed feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
        ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    </p>
    <p>
        Hey Zirm! First of all, I thought your personal narrative was very candid and insightful, and it taught an important message about the value of hard work. You captured this idea very creatively through the story of your brothers as a source of inspiration, and how you eventually realized that it would not be so simple to follow in their footsteps. Also, the narrative arc was presented very clearly and it helped me feel like I was experiencing the story in real time. You built up the tension well with the anecdotes about your brother’s success, there was a clear turning point when you realized that you would need to train hard to find similar success, and there was a salient resolution at the end in which you communicated the values you learned.
    </p>
    <p>
        With regards to the emotional of your narrative, I thought that overall you did a very good job. After all the hard work you put in, I really felt defeated alongside you when you did not succeed in making the basketball team in any of the times you tried out. However, there were a couple of scenes that I thought would become even more poignant if you gave them a little more airtime. A great example of that room for expansion is the scene I just mentioned: when you did not succeed in making the team in any of the times that you tried. You wrote “After not making the tryouts my senior year, I went to the park I always practiced at and stat there and cried.” For example, if you described your mindset and how you felt at that moment a bit more, I think it would really bolster the conclusion of your essay.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a couple of more minor points that I also want to handle before I finish up. There are a few minor formatting issues that probably should be corrected before you submit the final draft, but a quick proofread should easily resolve them. While the essay was told in a very personal way and that helped me to feel like I was experiencing the story with you, I felt that the language was sometimes a bit informal and basic. For instance, at the top of the third page, you wrote “While they didn’t get the championship they had been looking for, making it to the semi-finals was something huge to be proud of.” You can probably improve the sentence by expanding the contraction at the beginning of the sentence and reworking the second half of the sentence to more elaborately express the importance of your brothers’ partial success.
