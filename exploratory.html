<h1>Joyful Running</h1>
<p>
    So why do I run? Why do I keep lacing up my sneakers and heading out to go through the same motions, to run down the same routes, often to pass the same people, and without any tangible result? Perhaps, my wizened source of inspiration on that cold winter day can help clarify the answer. His advanced age helped me realize that anyone who makes the decision to throw on a pair of sneakers and commit themselves to running, will find themselves a part of a broad community spanning continents and generations. The day I decided to start running was the day I joined a diverse group of likeminded dedicated people.
</p>
<p>
    The more I thought about this point, the more it resonated with me. Running has allowed me to readily connect and find common ground with individuals who I would otherwise have had little to no relationship. For instance, a few weeks I went to spend Shabbat with my friend in Philadelphia and to join the celebration in honor of his upcoming wedding. Given the late hour at which Shabbat ended and the long drive back, I decided to stay in Philadelphia for an additional night. Since I did not want to miss a day of running, but I was entirely unfamiliar with the area, before we left the synagogue following the conclusion of Shabbat, I asked my friend if he knew of any enjoyable running routes in the neighborhood. Not being a runner, he directed me to seek advice from a man sitting a few rows in front of us. This man was a neuroscientist who researched at both the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University, and still managed to run upwards of fifty miles a week! What started as an innocuous conversation regarding favorable local running routes, quickly shifted into a wide ranging discussion about his fascinating research, the source of his impressive work ethic, and how he was able to manage his time so well. Given that I had very little in common with this man outside of running, without this common background, I never would have met and learned from this very accomplished individual. Small interactions like are one of the many unexpected benefits that I have found since I started to run.
</p>
<p>
    But this realization led me to wonder, what about other runners? How do they feel about running? Why do they enjoy the sport? According to a report from the Sports and Fitness Industry Association, there were over 50 million runners in 2019 (Kerman). What keeps bringing all of these people out to the roads and trails in the bitter cold and scorching heat? With these questions in hand, I decided to reach out to my runner friends, and ask them about why they like to run. After a quick glance around the Yeshiva University library, I chanced upon my two friends, Gadi and Eitan. I first asked Gadi “why do you enjoy running?” and to my great surprise he curtly replied: “I don’t,” as Eitan nodded in affirmation.
</p>
<p>
    Given that Eitan had recently completed a Sisyphean thirty-two mile circuit of the entire circumference of Manhattan, his agreement shocked me. How does one devote so much time and grueling effort to a pursuit that they do not even find pleasurable? I personally enjoy running for a number of reasons, beyond the sense of community that it provides. First, I generally run in the morning, and I find that exercise clears and sharpens my mind, and that that effect carries over and enhances the rest of my day. Additionally, now that I have been running regularly for nearly a year, and can run significant distances at respectable paces, I feel very accomplished after each run. Life is full of uncertainty, but having a part of my daily routine that I can successfully repeat day in and day out, gives me a reassuring sense of control.
</p>
<p>
    So I then followed up and asked “so why do you do it if you don’t enjoy it?” His following reply was even more enlightening “it’s not about the run itself, it’s about the after [sic] .” He then clarified that he was referring to the work ethic that can be built through consistent commitment to running (Sturm et al). Running is a very demanding sport, and installing it in one’s daily routine requires great dedication, especially for college students with a dual curriculum and busy schedules.
</p>
<p>
    Walking away from this conversation, I realized that many runners may be invested in the sport not for the process itself, but for the results that it engenders. Eitan specifically advocated running’s ability to foster a work ethic, but this left me wondering if there could be additional reasons. What other effects does running create that would motivate tens of millions of people to go outside and run? My conversation with my friends in the library helped me realize that runners may keep coming back to running because of reasons that affect them subconsciously. If Eitan and Gadi were unwilling or perhaps unable to articulate why they run, it could be because the reason is something intangible and not easily described in words.
</p>
<p>
    The first possibility that sprung to mind was the positive effects that exercise can have on mental health. In the past, I had briefly chanced upon articles describing this phenomenon that were targeted at a general audience, but I decided to take a deeper look at the issue by analyzing peer reviewed research. A quick search through Yeshiva University’s library resources yielded a great number of promising results. It seems that this question has been well researched and documented, and that the overwhelming evidence suggests that running, amongst other physical activity, has numerous potential mental health benefits. For instance, in 2005, a group of researches affiliated with the World Health Organization and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that exercise can serve as an effective treatment for depression and argued that “Mental health professionals as a group are an underused, highly valuable resource for the promotion of physical activities” (Saxena S. et al.) They are so confident in exercise’s ability to assist in the promotion of mental well being, that they advocate for it to be adopted on a public health intervention level in order to assist in combatting mental illness.
</p>
<p>
    But this discovery left me wondering: how exactly does running and other forms of physical activity promote mental well being? Another look through some scientific literature quickly yielded a number of possible answers. First of all, a significant body of research suggested that positive psychological factors are responsible for the improved mental well being. In 2007, Marie Donaghy, a researcher affiliated with Queen Margaret University, wrote that “Planning and undertaking exercise allows setting and achieving goals, skill development, building self-confidence and it may also provide a mechanism for social support if exercising with others.” But Donaghy also notes that exercise’s benefits may also be derived from physiological factors. She noted that “The increased blood flow to the brain stimulates the release of naturally occurring mood-enhancing chemicals known as endorphins; these natural opiates are similar to morphine and have been linked to the ‘runners high.’”
</p>
<p>
    If the uplifting effect that exercise is indeed sourced in this chemical response, I think that I can help explain why runners love to run so much even though they cannot necessarily explain why. While explaining the effects that dopamine and endorphins have on the body, Donagh makes a fascinating comparison between exercise and drugs and alcohol. She writes that “rewarding experiences release dopamine telling the brain ‘to do it again,’” and, therefore, “repeated abuse of illicit drugs or alcohol lays down memories that are difficult to diminish. These memories are triggered by cues associated with drug taking or drinking, increasing risk of relapse in addicts.” Donagh herself note that the evidence is not conclusive, but perhaps runners keep coming back to the sport because of these positive “memories” that it can form. Whether or not they consciously make this association, the memories associated with the pleasurable experience known as the runner’s high, may be what keeps drawing people back. Gadi, Eitan, and I may not actively be seeking these experiences when we go running, but the fact that they do occur could be what keeps drawing us back.
</p>
<p>
    But I personally find this explanation of why running can provide psychological benefit to not be satisfying because of personal anecdotal evidence. I rarely ever feel some kind of “high” while or after running, and, therefore, I am left wondering if there could be a different explanation for the improved mental wellbeing. Indeed, Attila Szabo, a biophysicist, argued that the psychological benefits of exercise cannot be explained through physiological responses alone, but are also driven by the placebo affect. Meaning, part of the reason that exercise can boost a person’s mood is because they expect it to improve their wellbeing. He quoted a fascinating study conducted by Crum and Langer, two psychologists affiliated with Harvard University, in which eighty four hotel room attendants received a physical examination at the beginning and end of a four week period. Half of the group was informed that their profession met the Surgeon General’s threshold of physical activity for an active lifestyle, and the other half of the group received no such information. The conclusion of the study found that “the informed group showed statistically significant decreases in weight, blood pressure, body fat, waist-to-hip ratio and body mass index.” Seemingly, the mere fact that someone expects exercise to improve their health is able to cause quantifiable improvements. This study, amongst other evidence, led Szabo to conclude that “Physical and placebo effects may jointly contribute to the acute mental benefits of exercise.”
</p>
<p>
    Unlike my previous suggestion, this research found that the health benefits of exercise at least partially stem from the expectations of the exercisers. But if this is the case, then how can I explain why runners such as Gadi and Eitan continue to run even if they do not enjoy it? This study argued that people must actively expect health benefits in order to receive them, and that is clearly not always the case. Therefore, even though my anecdotal evidence led me to doubt my previous suggestion, I now find it more compelling because it addresses this issue of why runners are unable to explain their attraction to the sport. Even though I personally could not identify a consistent “runner’s high” in my own experience, it best explains why people continue to run even though they do not actively enjoy the process of running. Perhaps, this is what Eitan meant when he said that “it’s about the after.”
