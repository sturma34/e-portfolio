  <h1>The Running Community</h1>
  <p>
      Thump, thump, thump. As I loped down the frozen tarmac, the foam soles of my worn royal blue sneakers maintained
      a steady beat. Flanked by an unbroken stream of vehicles traveling the Henry Hudson Parkway on my left, and the
      murky albeit serene waters of the Hudson River on my right, I faced nothing but miles and miles of open road. But
      with the trees bare, the sky overcast, and the trail empty, the world felt oddly monochromatic. The only sign of
      life for miles on end was the upbeat rock music streaming into my ears. As if sensing my exasperation with the
      dreary winter day and seeking to accentuate this feeling, a blustery wind suddenly rushed in from the west. Even
      though I was clad from head to toe in my warmest running apparel, the gust still managed to find its way inside
      and deliver its biting chill. So why was I outside running in below-freezing weather, when I could have been
      enjoying my newly found freedom from school within the four walls of my home? What possibly could have motivated
      me to do such a thing?
  </p>
  <p>
      With my first semester at Yeshiva University drawing to a close, many people were eagerly awaiting the elaborate
      vacations that they had planned for winter break. However, one major obstacle still obscured the path to freedom:
      final exams. Talking to upperclassmen who had already undergone this crucible before, I received the impression
      that final exams were a freight train that mercilessly bared down upon each and every student. Indeed, when
      reading week began and the looming presence of the final exams became ever more tangible, the stress became
      palpable. While I was sitting and studying in the “Heights Lounge,” the ceaseless clatter of dozens of keyboards
      was echoing off the room’s cavernous walls. I felt like I was on an assembly line and surrounded by numerous
      frantic employees attempting to churn out products that meet industry standards at breakneck speed.

      Attempting to juggle debugging an intricate order management program for my Introduction to Computer Science class, a paper investigating the near conversion to Christianity of Franz Rosenzweig, and studying for multiple exams, I was feeling a bit overwhelmed by the workload. So, I decided that I needed something after finals to which I could look forward. But what would it be? It needed to be something invigorating and exciting that I had never done before. If it also left me with a good story to tell, that would be an added bonus. After some deliberation, I made up my mind; I was going to run from Washington Heights, a neighborhood at the top of Manhattan, to Battery Park, its southernmost tip. In terms of route complexity, this run could not have been easier: the beautiful Hudson River Greenway spans the entire length of Manhattan, and would serve me well for the duration of the run. In terms of the distance, however, a half marathon presented an unprecedented challenge for me. When I mentioned my plans to my friend Eitan, also a dedicated runner, his response was something along the lines of “You crazy, bro.”

      When the day finally arrived, and I clicked “submit” on the final exam for my Conversions to and From Judaism class, I could not have been more excited. I slammed my computer shut, threw it into my backpack, and bolted towards the library’s elevator bank as quickly as my feet would allow me. I frenetically tapped the faded “down” button, and heard the antiquated elevator’s familiar creaking and groaning as the gears began to turn. This time, however, the elevator was not coming to shuttle me from the library to class and back, but to my freedom. When the doors finally parted, I quickly hopped in and continued on my way back to my dorm room to change. As I slipped on my gloves and was about to head out the door, my roommate, Ariel, walked in, and asked “Where are you headed?” “Battery Park” was my swift response as I burst out the door. My answer barely even seemed to register with him. “OK cool, see you in a few weeks. I’m heading home in a few minutes” was all that he called after me on my way out the door.

      I hit the road, and the first number of miles all seemed to feel exactly the same. They were a monotonous slog through an unpleasant winter climate. But as the miles accrued, the day’s colorless layers suddenly peeled away. The sun’s abrupt emergence in tandem with my body finally warming up alleviated the previously intolerable cold. As I continued on, what I previously had thought impossible on such a day occurred: I felt uncomfortably warm on a very chilly winter day. But even though I had left the cold behind in my dust, I could not escape the day’s monotony and lack of color. This lack of variety or excitement presented a unique mental challenge that, while often a problem when it comes to running, was further exacerbated by the wintry conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
      But this all changed as soon as I entered the Upper West Side. Previously, I was largely running unaccompanied, without a visible soul for miles on end. The stretch of road that I was now entering, however, was a veritable runner’s playground for the hundreds of thousands of Upper Manhattan residents. What had previously been a bleak monotonous day was now a startling kaleidoscope of colors. The avid runners, the bikers soaring past in a blur, the casual walkers, and even the rollerbladers were a diverse group and had myriad reasons for being out there on that cold winter day. They all had one thing in common, however, their brilliant dress. My vision was now awash with neon shirts, pants, shorts, and shoes, that were colored yellow, pink, green, and blue. Previously, it seemed that all life had scurried away to find shelter from winter’s grasp, but this feeling was obliterated by the onrush of dazzling hues. I could not help but be awed by this onslaught of color.
  </p>
  <p>
      Soon, however, even this new energy that I was enjoying wore off and faded away. I was surrounded by enthusiastic runners, bikers, and walkers, but nothing could change the fact that every step that I took felt identical to the previous one. Having run so many times before, I thought that I had already reached a point at which this repetition would no longer irk me. The unusual monotony and dreariness of this particular day, however, was weighing heavily upon me. Nonetheless, since I was already more than two thirds of the way through my journey, I resolved to attain my ultimate goal. I knew that I was physically fit and capable of this achievement, but the monotony provided a unique challenge. Therefore, I asked myself: what can I do to make sure that I do not fall short of 13.1 miles? How will I push forward and continue on this run?
  </p>
  <p>
      Well off in the distance, still obscured in that day's dreary fog, the answer to my question presented himself. Another man, running at approximately the same pace as mine and two hundred yards ahead of me, was passing through a set of chrome covered bollards.  Whether it was the gazelle-like gracefulness and ease with which he was covering ground, or whether it was merely the benchmark that his running provided, he was now my competition. I had to pass this man. As my stride quickened and the gap between us grew ever smaller, his form came into sharper focus. Clad from head to toe in neon running gear: hat, jacket, leggings and shoes, his appearance was entirely unremarkable. He represented but a drop in a sea of neon clad athletes who chose to run that day. As I inched my way ever closer and eventually began to pass him, I caught a glimpse of his weathered face. He had a kind smile and gentle features, but I was instantly taken with his advanced age. His face was deeply wrinkled, dotted with old age’s gray spots, and topped with a shock of white hair. Nonetheless, he was out there on this cold winter day, doing what he loves: the sport of running.

      Inspired by this elderly man’s commitment and passion, my excitement rose and I quickened my pace. What had previously felt like an arduous journey to reach that magic number of 13.1 miles, now felt like a surreal jump through space and time. As I passed under the Freedom Tower’s shadow with my destination in sight, I wondered where those last miles had gone. Reaching my goal, Battery Park, the southernmost point of Manhattan, I finally let my feet come to a rest. I glanced down at my phone, and I found “13.34 miles” staring back at me. With the background of the Statue of Liberty and the New York harbor awash in the sun’s warm glow, I stood in awe of what I had just accomplished. I had begun running in earnest no more than nine months prior to this moment, and, yet, I had just surpassed one of the defining boundaries of the sport. I had run a half marathon. The feeling of setting a lofty goal and not just meeting it, but soaring past it, was cathartic and gratifying. I could not think of a better way to cap a semester of hard work, many late nights of studying, and hours of debugging computer programs.
  </p>

      As I began my lethargic walk to the subway station for my return trip to Washington Heights, I asked myself “what keeps bringing me out to run? Why do I keep lacing up the same pair of running shoes, pulling the same winter hat down over my ears, and slipping on the same pair of gloves? Why do I keep heading out and repeating the same runs again and again? Wherein lies this sport’s allure?” It was at this moment that I thought back to the elderly man that I passed during my run. Out of the myriad runners that I had passed or was passed by, why did he stand out? I realized then that is must have been his advanced age. His presence on the trail that day was a prime example of running’s universality. Anyone who makes the decision to throw on a pair of sneakers and commit themselves to running, will find themselves a part of a broad  community spanning continents and generations. The day I decided to start running was the day I joined a diverse group of likeminded dedicated people.
