<h1>The Boston Marathon's Righteous Ban</h1>
<p>
    Dear Mr. Stephens,
</p>
<p>
    Approximately four weeks ago, you published an article entitled “The Boston Marathon’s Brainless Bigotry,” and argued that the Boston Athletic Association’s (B.A.A.) decision to bar Russian and Belarusian athletes from competition was ill advised and flouted democratic ideals. When I initially read your piece, the war had already been raging for over a month, and I naively hoped that it would not continue for much longer. However, as I write this letter, the bloodshed in Ukraine has yet to cease. Just this morning, the Associated Press reported that the Russian Air Force flattened a building in which approximately 90 people were taking shelter. Two corpses were recovered, thirty survivors were rescued, and the governor of the Luhansk Province, Serhiy Haidai, reported that “Most likely, all 60 people who remain under the rubble are now dead.” (Becatoros) This wanton act of terror that ended so many lives occurred in a school—a location that, up until two months ago, was associated with education and the perpetuation of the Ukrainian future. This painful irony made this particular piece of news all the more startling. Even in the face of crippling economic sanctions, intense diplomatic pressure, and increasing Western military support for Ukraine, Putin remains defiant and on the offensive. Hence, I feel that a response to your article, while overdue, is still immediately relevant.

</p>
<p>
    Mr. Stephens, I must admit that you posited a number of salient points. You noted that many Russian and Belarusian citizens, everyday people, opposed the military initiative, even when their actions risked imprisonment at the hands of the government. Indeed, in the weeks since the publishing of your article, the protests have continued, even in the face of violent and comprehensive government crackdowns, and have only grown to be more creative and resourceful (Kellog). Therefore, given that the athletes could very well belong to the camp of Russian citizens who staunchly oppose the conflict, they are being unfairly targeted. You also noted that Americans should exist above the fray, and “democratic societies never shine brighter than when they uphold these principles in the face of adversaries who flout them.” I found these words to be particularly inspirational and understand from where they are coming. Essentially, you are arguing against the nullification of the private citizen, and that great care must be taken to protect and safeguard the rights of the individual. This point, in particular, truly resonates with me. I am an amateur runner myself, and have dedicated dozens upon dozens of hours to the sport. I can easily relate to the perceived unfairness of having the opportunity to actualize hard work snatched away. The sport of running represents pure achievement of the individual, and, therefore being banned due to involuntary affiliation with a larger group would be particularly frustrating and disheartening.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, you argued that the actions of the B.A.A. would end up being counterproductive on two fronts. First, in reducing private citizens to the political beliefs of their country, they are unintentionally facilitating Putin and Lukashenko’s efforts to have their people believe that the autocratic leaders speak on their people’s behalf. Second, this ban validates Putin’s long term campaign to criticize “Woke Western culture for being censorious and repressive, not to mention hypocritical.” This point should also not be underestimated because Putin’s campaign of disinformation has been a critical component in allowing him to remain in power for all these years. He has fed the Russian people a steady stream of propaganda to counter the Western claims of genocide, and has successfully used this campaign to maintain public support and boost his domestic rating (CBS). Therefore, logic would seemingly dictate that any actions that strengthen Putin’s autocratic disinformation capabilities should certainly be avoided.
</p>
<p>
    Your arguments, each compelling in their own right, together form a convincing whole that clearly delineates the numerous reasons that militate against a ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competition. The position that you maintain is eminently reasonable, and, in fact, is quite similar to my initial opinion on the matter. Upon first reading about this ban, I too was astounded by this ostensibly audacious overstepping of boundaries on the part of the B.A.A. I too was deeply concerned about the negation of the athletes’ achievement, and the seemingly unfair association with the Russian government. Your point about the B.A.A. inadvertently assisting the Russian government, however, was entirely novel to me, and I am grateful to you for expanding my horizons and helping me to further grasp the gravity of the issue.
</p>
<p>
    However, as I further contemplated the matter, I realized that my gut reaction may not have taken other important considerations into account. Some of the aforementioned concerns were largely centered around the individual and, while obviously important, they were more concerned with short term issues of specific athletic competitions. However, we should not lose sight of the bigger picture. In one of the printed responses to your opinion piece, a New York Times reader named Dena Davis wrote “that when apartheid in South Africa finally crumbled, one of the reasons given was the shame and frustration that South Africans felt when their athletes were barred from international competitions.” Indeed, a group of researchers found that while the effect of sports diplomacy in South Africa may have been exaggerated, it had "an important symbolic function in the anti-apartheid struggle and was able to influence the other policy actors" (Keech). Therefore, while banning athletes may not directly contribute towards weakening the Russian regime and ending the war, it contributes towards civil unrest and reducing the popularity of the government. While you effectively argued that the athletic ban may strengthen Putin’s argument that he speaks on the entire country’s behalf, it would likely only provide him with temporary assistance. In the long term, however, I think that continuously maintaining exclusionary policies against athletes and other popular figures would end up being more effective. Prior to this ban, the West had engaged in and laid numerous sanctions upon the powerful Russian oligarchs, but the effort to oppose the Russian influence must impact a broader section of the population. In a 2015 report, PBS recorded that 119 individual businessman, representing 0.00008 percent of the population, controlled nineteen percent of all the household wealth in Russia (Breslow). These sanctions are important in that they curtail the influence of the Russsian elite, however, these oligarchs exist in an entirely different stratosphere of wealth than the general population. On the other hand, athletes are often considered to be role models and hold a special place in the public’s heart. If beloved icons are consistently being turned away whenever they seek opportunities abroad, the sense of “shame and frustration” will multiply and discord will be sowed amongst the Russian common folk. Meaning, the long term effect may counter any short term strengthening of Putin’s perceived ability to unify and represent the Russian public.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, I would like to return to you the first point that you made regarding the importance of not associating every Russian citizen with their country. Indeed, thousands of citizens have protested the Russian war crimes even when it directly placed them at risk of indiscriminate imprisonment. These courageous individuals should be lauded and their heroic fortitude in the face of great persecution cannot be taken for granted. At the same time, however, the thousands of people arrested represent but a small fraction of the 144 million people that constitute the bulk of Russia’s population. Again, the efforts of those who protested should not be discounted, but the majority of the population has remained complacent. Hence, if the athletic ban has any hope of galvanizing additional citizens to oppose the war efforts, it will certainly be worthwhile.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the day, I recognize that certain values stand to be compromised when such athletic bans are instituted, but in the face of ongoing conflict, bloodshed, and war crimes, that is a sacrifice that I am willing to make.
</p>
<p>
    Sincerely,<br>
    Akiva Sturm
